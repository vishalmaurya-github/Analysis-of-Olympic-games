1. Data Analysis and Visualization: Developed an interactive Olympic data analysis app using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `plotly`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`, enabling dynamic visualizations like line plots, heatmaps, and scatter plots to display trends and insights.

2. Streamlit Web App Development: Gained hands-on experience in building data-driven web applications with Streamlit, creating a user-friendly interface for analyzing medal tallies, country-wise performance, and athlete statistics.

3. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: Implemented data cleaning techniques, merged multiple datasets, and applied feature engineering (one-hot encoding for medals) to prepare data for in-depth analysis and visualization.
